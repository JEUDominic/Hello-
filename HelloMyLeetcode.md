#LeetCode
##Add Digits

	Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

	For example:
	
	Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.



**Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?**

HINT: the remainder of 9


##Single Number

	Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?**

HINT: Using XOR.


##Invert Binary Tree

	Invert a binary tree.

**Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.**

HINT: Recursion


## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

	Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
	The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
